# IMBD Mongo Aggregator

This is a simple data aggregator for IMBD's public datasets. The program receives the datasets and converts them to MongoDB-compliant JSON files, which can then be imported via the MongoDB CLI or MongoDB Compass.

Graded assignment for the Databases II course, which is part of the Software Engineering course at PUC-RS.
